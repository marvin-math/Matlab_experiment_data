# Overview
This programming project deals with a common problem: Converting data from multiple
participants into a form that we can work with. The log files from several participants were automatically created by the experiment presenting software Presentation. The provided code reads in the data, restructures it and statistically analyses it.

# Experimental design
The experiment is a variation of a task by Mier and colleagues published among others in:\
Mier, D., Lis, S., Neuthe, K., Sauer, C., Esslinger, C., Gallhofer, B., & Kirsch, P. (2010). The
involvement of emotion recognition in affective theory of mind. Psychophysiology, 47(6),
1028-1039.\
In this experiment, participants see a sentence followed by four pictures of faces. Their
task is to decide as quickly as possible whether the sentence accurately describes the face.
The faces portray the following emotions: fear, anger, happiness. The sentences require
the participants either to judge the appearance regardless of emotion (control condition),
the emotion portrayed (affect recognition) or make an inference on a likely action (theory
of mind). Half of the faces are adults, the other half children. Therefore, there are three
factors to consider:\
● Task: control, theory of mind, affect recognition\
● Emotion: fear, anger, happiness\
● Protagonist: child, adult\
There are 216 presentations of the faces in total, 12 per condition. Each child and adult is
shown once with each emotion in each task condition. The sentences used are always the
same.

# How to Execute the Code
Please save the participants data and the data_analysis_file in the same folder. Then just run the data_analysis file and all tasks will be executed.
